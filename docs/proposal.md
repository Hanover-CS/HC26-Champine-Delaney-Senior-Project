Recipe app that saves preferences and available ingredients and tools

My app will allow you to search a database for recipes based on their ingredients and the tools required to make them as well as other search criteria. users should be able to save recipes. They should also be able to save things like allergies or ingredients they cannot have. Will have home screen, search screen, saved recipes screen, settings screen, and maybe others.

A similar existing app is the tasty app. It allows you to search for recipes with words or by adding filters or looking through different groups of recipes of a certain theme. There are many ways to search on this app and it can do most of what I want my app to do. I just want my app to be more personalized and save preferences so that users do not need to put in the filters they need every time. you can also make meal plans on this app, which i may want to do, but it requires a premium version on the tasty app.
