An android app that logs insect/other discoveries as pictures with location and date

My app will allow you to save discoveries in a database with description, time, and date. May use API like inaturalist to help user identify. Keeps track of discoveries in an organized way. May incorporate maps and game-like elements.

A similar existing app is Picture Insect which lets users identify insects using image recognition software. The app does keep track of discoveries but does not organize it well and does not let the user add personal notes to the data entry or keep track of date and time.
