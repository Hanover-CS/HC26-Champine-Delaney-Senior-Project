# Tutorial:  
## AI Image Training With Google Colaboratory  
This tutorial will explain how to set up, train, and test an instance of PyTorch AI. Specifically training and testing it in image recognition: to be able to interperate images and visual data in a way that is helpful for us.
### Step 1: Set Up  
  First, sign into Google Colaboratory using a Google account.  
  
  Google Colab is connected to other Google applications on the account and "notebooks" created can be managed in Google Drive. Notebooks in Google Colab are documents that can hold both text and executable code. Or, in our case, Notebooks allow users to easily access PyTorch AI and Images in our Google Drive in the same document and help us easily export the AI when training is finished.
