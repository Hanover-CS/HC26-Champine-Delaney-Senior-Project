An android app that logs insect/other discoveries as pictures with location and date

My app will allow you to save discoveries in a database with description, time, and date. May use API like inaturalist to help user identify. Keeps track of discoveries in an organized way. May incorporate maps and recognition software.

## First resource: Picture Insect

A similar existing app is Picture Insect which lets users identify insects using image recognition software. The app does keep track of discoveries but does not organize it well and does not let the user add personal notes to the data entry or keep track of date and time.

## Second Resource: Inaturalist API


## Third Resource: Room DB

[Room DB](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)

This is a tool for creating databases with Android Studio in Android apps.

This is a resource I think I will be able to use to keep track of data in my app and remember the user's information even after they leave the app.

## languages:
Kotlin: for Android app functionality
I chose Kotlin specifically because of its easy to read and understand code and because it has some security measures in place that other languages such as c++ and Java do not have. This could mean less time trying to fix problems in the code and more time improving my project.
Jetpack Compose: for UI in app
I chose Kotlin and Jetpack Compose because I have experience making Android apps with them and setting up the environment.
Python used in Google colab to train and export AI. 
I chose Google Colab because it is probably the most efficient way to train image recognition software for free.
