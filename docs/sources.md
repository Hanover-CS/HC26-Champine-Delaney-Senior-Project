An android app that logs insect/other discoveries as pictures with location and date

My app will allow you to save discoveries in a database with description, time, and date. May use API like inaturalist to help user identify. Keeps track of discoveries in an organized way. May incorporate maps and recognition software.

## First resource: Picture Insect

A similar existing app is Picture Insect which lets users identify insects using image recognition software. The app does keep track of discoveries but does not organize it well and does not let the user add personal notes to the data entry or keep track of date and time.

## Second Resource: Inaturalist API


## Third Resource: Room DB

[Room DB](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)

This is a tool for creating databases with Android Studio in Android apps.

This is a resource I think I will be able to use to keep track of data in my app and remember the user's information even after they leave the app.

## languages:
Kotlin: for Android app functionality
Jetpack Compose: for UI in app
Python used in Google colab to train and export AI.
