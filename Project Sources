# First Resource: ReciMe Cooking App

[ReciMe](https://recime.app/)
Primary source
This is an existing app that has search-by-ingredient functions and meal planning capabilities. It is an app used to find recipes, save recipes, and create meal plans for yourself. It shows nutrition facts and recommends recipes based on previous activity.

The apps features that I would like to have are searching by ingredient, saving recipes, and showing nutrition facts.

# Second Resource: Spoonacular API

[Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
This is an API containing thousands of recipes and is used by many recipe apps. It can provide data on ingredients, recipes, and many other food-related categories. 

This is a resource I think would be useful for my app in order to get access to so much data about recipes and ingredients.

# Third Resource: Room DB

[Room DB](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)

This is a tool for creating databases with Android Studio in Android apps.

This is a resource I think I will be able to use to keep track of data in my app and remember the user's information even after they leave the app.
